## Step-by-Step Process: Crafting the Perfect Sandal  

Creating a handmade sandal is an art. Here's how it's done:


### 1. The Journey Begins with Sizing  
We start by measuring both feet to ensure the best fit. For example:  

| Measurement       | Left Foot (cm) | Right Foot (cm) |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Length            | 27.3           | 27.5            |
| Instep Volume     | 22.1           | 22.3            |
| Ball Point Volume | 10.1           | 10.2            |

These measurements help us choose the right last, which shapes the sandal.
You take the average of both values. For the length of the feet, You add 14cm to the average value to determine the UK size. Measuring my feet gave me, after adding 14cm. i arrived at cm.

### 2. Picking the Right Last  
The selected last ensures a perfect fit for ultimate comfort.
For my size, I wear size 45, so is select a plastic mold last.

---

### 3. Crafting the Pattern  
Using **cardboard paper** or recycled materials, we craft the pattern. For example, we repurpose packaging boxes from local hairdressers, making the process eco-friendly and cost-effective.  
**The image** below shows a well detailed dimensioning on how to construct the upper pattern but i use free hand sketching to do mine(For beginners, i advise you try the dimensions)

### 4. Selecting Material  
When choosing the materials sfor the upper, i use the international standard which is pure leather for the top and i use either soft leather linen or normal linen. 
I use a Maco foam with 4mm thickness and fibre board to create the insole. You can select your choice of color for wrapping the insole.

### 5. Shaping the Insole  
The insole is carefully created to fit perfectly and provide long-lasting comfort. A durable rubber sole is selected for its quality.

### 6. Assembly  
The upper is placed on the last, adhesive is applied, and adjustments are made for a seamless finish.
